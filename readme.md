Usage:

- Type the faces of your dice in the "Roll 1" field, (for instance "15536", the order does not matter) the UI will indicate which dice to keep (reroll the rest)
- Repeat in boxes "Roll 2/3" until the UI tells you which box to score
- Type your score in the relevant box in the upper side of the interface
- Repeat until end of game :)

Congrats, you have now beaten Yahtzee.
